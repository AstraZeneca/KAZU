Eosinophilia is a characteristic of certain asthma and COPD phenotypes and depletion of eosinophils has demonstrated therapeutic benefit. Benralizumab was recently approved by the US FDA as add-on maintenance therapy for patients with severe asthma who have an eosinophilic phenotype. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of benralizumab leading to this first approval for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma.\", \"Benralizumab: First Global Approval.\", \"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) both have a high prevalence worldwide and yet each condition remains underdiagnosed. Despite a number of common features, these inflammatory respiratory syndromes have distinct clinical outcomes. COPD represents a greater economic burden than asthma because it has a less favourable prognosis and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage, so that appropriate therapy can be prescribed to prevent deterioration. However, effective treatments that may be used in both conditions can minimise the effects of misdiagnosis and maximise the impact of treatment without the associated complexity when both conditions occur together. The current review summarises the differences and similarities of asthma and COPD, in terms of risk factors, pathophysiology, symptoms and diagnosis, to provide greater understanding of the role of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler in both diseases.\", \"Asthma and COPD: differences and similarities. With special reference to the usefulness of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) in both diseases.\", \"Parasitism by Cuscuta and Orobanche on Petunia hybrida resulted in decreased choline kinase activity and phospholipids in the host shoots. The Cuscuta-infected host roots suffered a decline in phospholipid concentration with no appreciable change in enzyme activity, whereas the roots of the Orobanche-infected plants exhibited a substantial increase in phospholipid concentration despite a marked lowering in enzymic activity. Superimposition of infection by Cuscuta on Orobanche-infected plants resulted in an increase in both enzyme activity and phospholipid in host shoots; the host roots recorded a decline in phospholipid, although enzyme activity was increased. As compared to the filaments infecting singly, Cuscuta, in sequential infection, registered an increase in phospholipid concomitant with a fall in enzyme activity, whereas the root parasite revealed a lowered enzyme activity and a slight decrease in phospholipid. It is hypothesized that a physiological response to infection by root parasite was an accumulation of phospholipids at the region under infection, and to that by shoot parasite was an uptake of phospholipids by the parasite from the host; this was effected not by de novo synthesis but rather by mobilization from distal regions.\", \"Studies on Sequential Parasitism by Orobanche and Cuscuta on Petunia hybrida: Choline Kinase and Phospholipid.\", \"Proton pump inhibitors are the standard of treatment for acid-related disorders. These disorders include gastroesophageal reflux disease and its complications (i.e., erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus), peptic ulcer disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and idiopathic hypersecretion. Proton pump inhibitors are also successfully used for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. There are currently five proton pump inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration and available in the United States. These are omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium). This review discusses the history of proton pump inhibitors and compares and evaluates the pharmacology including mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, administration, dosage, and drug interactions. Information regarding therapeutic indications, clinical efficacy, short- and long-term side effects, and cost is also presented. A case presentation offers an analysis of the use of proton pump inhibitors in individualized patient care.\", \"An overview of proton pump inhibitors.\", \"It has been suggested that the supermarket of today will be the pharmacy of tomorrow. Such statements have been derived from recognition of our increasing ability to optimize nutrition, and maintain a state of good health through longer periods of life. The new field of nutrigenomics, which focuses on the interaction between bioactive dietary components and the genome, recognizes that current nutritional guidelines may be ideal for only a relatively small proportion of the population. There is good evidence that nutrition has significant influences on the expression of genes, and, likewise, genetic variation can have a significant effect on food intake, metabolic response to food, individual nutrient requirements, food safety, and the efficacy of disease-protective dietary factors. For example, a significant number of human studies in various areas are increasing the evidence for interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various genes and the metabolic response to diet, including the risk of obesity. Many of the same genetic polymorphisms and dietary patterns that influence obesity or cardiovascular disease also affect cancer, since overweight individuals are at increased risk of cancer development. The control of food intake is profoundly affected by polymorphisms either in genes encoding taste receptors or in genes encoding a number of peripheral signaling peptides such as insulin, leptin, ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and corresponding receptors. Total dietary intake, and the satiety value of various foods, will profoundly influence the effects of these genes. Identifying key SNPs that are likely to influence the health of an individual provides an approach to understanding and, ultimately, to optimizing nutrition at the population or individual level. Traditional methods for identification of SNPs may involve consideration of individual variants, using methodologies such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms or quantitative real-time PCR assays. New developments allow identification of up to 500,000 SNPs in an individual, and with increasingly lowered pricings these developments may explode the population-level potential for dietary optimization based on nutrigenomic approaches.\", \"Nutrigenomics: integrating genomic approaches into nutrition research.\", \"On July 20, 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ticagrelor (Brilinta\\u2122) for use during acute coronary syndromes. The drug labeling includes a 'black box' warning for bleeding risks, conventional for antithrombotics, and a unique warning that higher than 100 mg/daily maintenance treatment with aspirin may reduce ticagrelor effectiveness. The approval was granted following ticagrelor secondary reviews, and review of complete response by FDA officials.\", \"To summarize the recommendations of different FDA reviewers, and their impact on drug approval.\", \"Review of the Platelet Inhibition and Clinical Outcomes (PLATO) trial comparing the efficacy of ticagrelor versus standard care treatment with clopidogrel.

Host Plant Response to Nitrogen Fixation by Rhizobium Strains.\", \"The regulator of cell cycle progression, cyclin D1, is up-regulated in breast cancer cells; its expression is, in part, dependent on ERalpha signaling. However, many ERalpha-negative tumors and tumor cell lines (e.g., SKBR3) also show over-expression of cyclin D1. This suggests that, in addition to ERalpha signaling, cyclin D1 expression is under the control of other signaling pathways; these pathways may even be over-expressed in the ERalpha-negative cells. We previously noticed that both ERalpha-positive and -negative cell lines over-express BRCA1-IRIS mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the level of over-expression of BRCA1-IRIS in ERalpha-negative cell lines even exceeded its over-expression level in ERalpha-positive cell lines. In this study, we show that: (1) BRCA1-IRIS forms complex with two of the nuclear receptor co-activators, namely, SRC1 and SRC3 (AIB1) in an ERalpha-independent manner. (2) BRCA1-IRIS alone, or in connection with co-activators, is recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter through its binding to c-Jun/AP1 complex; this binding activates the cyclin D1 expression. (3) Over-expression of BRCA1-IRIS in breast cells over-activates JNK/c-Jun; this leads to the induction of cyclin D1 expression and cellular proliferation. (4) BRCA1-IRIS activation of JNK/c-Jun/AP1 appears to account for this, because in cells that were depleted from BRCA1-IRIS, JNK remained inactive. However, depletion of SRC1 or SRC3 instead reduced c-Jun expression. Our data suggest that this novel signaling pathway links BRCA1-IRIS to cellular proliferation through c-Jun/AP1 nuclear pathway; finally, this culminates in the increased expression of the cyclin D1 gene.\", \"BRCA1-IRIS regulates cyclin D1 expression in breast cancer cells.\", \"A ribonuclease fraction previously purified from flax by gel filtration was further resolved into two components by hydroxyl apatite chromatography.

The relative amounts of these isozymes change markedly during infection. These observations provide an explanation for the apparent qualitative changes in RNase noted previously. Differences between susceptible and resistant reactions in the early stages of disease are discussed.\", \"Changes in two ribonuclease isozymes during rust infection of flax cotyledons.\", \"The mechanism responsible for phosphorus inhibition of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in sudangrass (Sorghum vulgare Pers.) was investigated in a phosphorus-deficient sandy soil (0.5 micrograms phosphorus per gram soil) amended with increasing levels of phosphorus as superphosphate (0, 28, 56, 228 micrograms per gram soil). The root phosphorus content of 4-week-old plants was correlated with the amount of phosphorus added to the soil. Root exudation of amino acids and reducing sugars was greater for plants grown in phosphorus-deficient soil than for those grown in the phosphorus-treated soils. The increase in exudation corresponded with changes in membrane permeability of phosphorus-deficient roots, as measured by K(+) ((86)Rb) efflux, rather than with changes in root content of reducing sugars and amino acids. The roots of phosphorus-deficient plants inoculated at 4 weeks with Glomus fasciculatus were 88% infected after 9 weeks as compared to less than 25% infection in phosphorus-sufficient roots; these differences were correlated with root exudation at the time of inoculation. For plants grown in phosphorus-deficient soil, infection by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae increased root phosphorus which resulted in a decrease in root membrane permeability and exudation compared to nonmycorrhizal plants. It is proposed that, under low phosphorus nutrition, increased root membrane permeability leads to net loss of metabolites at sufficient levels to sustain the germination and growth of the mycorrhizal fungus during pre- and postinfection. Subsequently, mycorrhizal infection leads to improvement of root phosphorus nutrition and a reduction in membrane-mediated loss of root metabolites.\", \"Membrane-mediated decrease in root exudation responsible for phorphorus inhibition of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza formation.\"];",
