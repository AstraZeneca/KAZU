          JsonEncodable failure is because it's recursive, but sphinx tries to
          expand it out, so this doesn't work.
          Note we used to have a non-recursive (but over-accepting) definition
          of JsonEncodable anyway, so that isn't the key blocker here (as we
          could have kept that definition and been happy enough).
          The NoneType failure is due to an issue with Sphinx handling builtins
          - see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/11571 as it used
          to work while using typing.Dict instead of the builtin dict.
          Switching to show JsonEncodable instead as it's simpler to write this
          override, plus I think more readable for users.
          An alternative would be to attempt to use Sphinx's
          autodoc_type_aliases
          https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_type_aliases
          but this requires doing ``from __future__ import annotations`` which
          could break pydantic stuff and have wider codebase implications, so
          this would be a potentially larger piece of work for not much gain.

    :class:`.SynonymTerm`.

    This can affect both the behaviour of :class:`kazu.ontology_preprocessing.base.OntologyParser`,
    and dictionary based NER.

    Example 1:

    The string 'ALL' is highly ambiguous. It might mean several diseases, or simply 'all'. Therefore, we want
    to add a curation as follows, so that it will only be used as a linking target and not for dictionary based NER:

    .. code-block:: python

        CuratedTerm(
            curated_synonym="ALL",
            case_sensitive=True,
            behaviour=CuratedTermBehaviour.ADD_FOR_LINKING_ONLY,
            associated_id_sets=None,
            mention_confidence=MentionConfidence.POSSIBLE,
        )


    Example 2:

    The string 'LH' is incorrectly identified as a synonym of the PLOD1 (ENSG00000083444) gene, whereas more often than not, it's actually an abbreviation of Lutenising Hormone.
    We therefore want to override the associated_id_sets to LHB (ENSG00000104826, or Lutenising Hormone Subunit Beta)

    The CuratedTerm we therefore want is:

    .. code-block:: python

        CuratedTerm(
            curated_synonym="LH",
            case_sensitive=True,
            behaviour=CuratedTermBehaviour.ADD_FOR_LINKING_ONLY,
            associated_id_sets=frozenset((EquivalentIdSet(("ENSG00000104826", "ENSEMBL")),)),
            mention_confidence=MentionConfidence.POSSIBLE,
        )

    Example 3:

    A :class:`.SynonymTerm` has an alternative synonym not referenced in the underlying ontology, and we want to add it.
    We want it to inherit all the behaviour from the original term

    .. code-block:: python

        CuratedTerm(
            curated_synonym="breast carcinoma",
            case_sensitive=True,
