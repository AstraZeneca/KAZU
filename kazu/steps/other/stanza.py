        To use this step, you will need `stanza <https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/>`_
        installed, which is not installed as part of the default kazu install
        because this step isn't used as part of the default pipeline.

        You can either do:

        .. code-block:: console

            $ pip install stanza

        Or you can install required dependencies for all steps included in kazu

            abstract = "{The study sought to develop and evaluate neural natural language processing (NLP) packages for the
            syntactic analysis and named entity recognition of biomedical and clinical English text.We implement and train
            biomedical and clinical English NLP pipelines by extending the widely used Stanza library originally designed
            for general NLP tasks. Our models are trained with a mix of public datasets such as the CRAFT treebank as well
            as with a private corpus of radiology reports annotated with 5 radiology-domain entities. The resulting
            pipelines are fully based on neural networks, and are able to perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging,
            lemmatization, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition for both biomedical and clinical text. We
            compare our systems against popular open-source NLP libraries such as CoreNLP and scispaCy, state-of-the-art
            models such as the BioBERT models, and winning systems from the BioNLP CRAFT shared task.For syntactic
            analysis, our systems achieve much better performance compared with the released scispaCy models and CoreNLP
            models retrained on the same treebanks, and are on par with the winning system from the CRAFT shared task. For
            NER, our systems substantially outperform scispaCy, and are better or on par with the state-of-the-art
            performance from BioBERT, while being much more computationally efficient.We introduce biomedical and clinical
            NLP packages built for the Stanza library. These packages offer performance that is similar to the state of the
            art, and are also optimized for ease of use. To facilitate research, we make all our models publicly available.
            We also provide an online demonstration (http://stanza.run/bio).}",
