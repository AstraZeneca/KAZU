class KazuToSpacyObjectMapper:
    """Maps entities and text from a :class:`.Section` to the spaCy data model using
    :func:`.basic_spacy_pipeline`\\.

    .. attention::
       Providing incomplete ``entity_classes`` for your usage (or leaving it blank)
       can lead to errors that might only occur infrequently when processing
       the results, and therefore may be difficult to track down.

       Therefore, users should be careful to set ``entity_classes`` to all the entity
       classes corresponding to attributes that they will access on the spaCy
       `Token <https://spacy.io/api/token>`_\\ s within the
       `Span <https://spacy.io/api/span>`_\\ s of the result of :meth:`.__call__`,
       whether directly or via spaCy `Matcher <https://spacy.io/api/matcher>`_ rules
       that check these custom attributes.


       The specific problem is that if you try to read a spaCy custom attribute that
       doesn't exist, you will get an error like::

          AttributeError: [E046] Can't retrieve unregistered extension attribute 'drug'.
          Did you forget to call the `set_extension` method?

       This class uses the provided ``entity_classes`` to call ``set_extension``. If
       the provided ``entity_classes`` is incomplete - say, missing ``"drug"`` - and
       you then try to access the ``drug`` attribute on a token in the result, you will
       get this error.
