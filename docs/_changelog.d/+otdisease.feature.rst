The OpenTargetsDiseaseOntologyParser has been heavily reworked, so that it uses the therapeutic_area concept to decide what records should be included. This has in turn yielded the subsets: measurement, medical_procedure, biological_process and phenotype. The measurement configuration is currently disabled as it requires heavy curation of the underlying strings. In addition, the OpenTargetsDiseaseOntologyParser now supports a custom ID grouping method, to make use of cross references.
