The API for building custom model packs has changed to be more flexible, and more simple.
This is a backwards-incompatible change, but we don't currently expect/know of any non-AstraZeneca users of this script, so won't do a major version bump for it.
Please let us know (in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/AstraZeneca/KAZU/issues/new)) if you are using this and this change was problematic for you.
