Deprecated `GildaUtils.replace_dashes` in favour of `GildaUtils.split_on_dashes_or_space`, as the latter improves efficiency in Kazu.
`GildaUtils.replace_dashes` will continue to work until kazu 1.6, but using it will produce a `DeprecationWarning`.
Please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AstraZeneca/KAZU/issues/new) if you wish this to remain.
