The Kazu Resource Tool
================================

The Kazu Resource Tool is a command line tool that can be used to find and resolve the various issues that can arise when working with :class:`.OntologyStringResource`\s in a Kazu project,
as decribed at the end of the :ref:`ontology_parser` section.

It's main purpose is to help you find and fix issues with your resource files, and to help you understand how your resources are configured.

First, ensure that ``KAZU_MODEL_PACK`` is set in your environment, as described in the :ref:`quickstart` section.

Now, from the root of your Kazu project, you can run the Kazu Resource Tool with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ streamlit run krt/Introduction.py

This will start a Streamlit server, which will allow you to interact with the Kazu Resource Tool in your browser.

Further instructions are described in the Streamlit app itself.
