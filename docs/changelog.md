% The `generated:` above is to mark this to prevent an edit button being added
% to the page when rendered. See docs/_templates/components/edit-this-page.html
% for how this works. This file uses MyST syntax for the generated 'role' and
% this comment, because it's markdown (because we want to keep our CHANGELOG
% in markdown).
