This model repository presents the NER module used in the initial release of the KAZU (Korea University and AstraZeneca) framework.
* For the framework, please visit https://github.com/AstraZeneca/KAZU
* For details about the model, please see our paper entitled [Biomedical NER for the Enterprise with Distillated BERN2 and the Kazu Framework**, (EMNLP 2022 industry track)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-industry.63).

    abstract = "In order to assist the drug discovery/development process, pharmaceutical companies often apply biomedical NER and linking techniques over internal and public corpora. Decades of study of the field of BioNLP has produced a plethora of algorithms, systems and datasets. However, our experience has been that no single open source system meets all the requirements of a modern pharmaceutical company. In this work, we describe these requirements according to our experience of the industry, and present Kazu, a highly extensible, scalable open source framework designed to support BioNLP for the pharmaceutical sector. Kazu is a built around a computationally efficient version of the BERN2 NER model (TinyBERN2), and subsequently wraps several other BioNLP technologies into one coherent system.",
