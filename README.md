# Kazu - Biomedical NLP

Welcome to Kazu (Korea AstraZeneca University), a python NLP library built in collaboration with Korea University,
designed to handle production workloads.

This library aims to simplify the process of using state of the art NLP research in production systems. Some of the 
research contained within are our own, but most of it comes from the community, for which we are immensely grateful.
