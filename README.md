# Kazu - Biomedical NLP Framework

Welcome to Kazu (Korea AstraZeneca University), a python biomedical NLP framework built in collaboration with Korea University,
designed to handle production workloads.

This library aims to simplify the process of using state of the art NLP research in production systems. Some of the
research contained within are our own, but most of it comes from the community, for which we are immensely grateful.

If you want to use Kazu, please cite our [EMNLP 2022 publication](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-industry.63)!
([**citation link**](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-industry.63.bib))

[Please click here for the **web live demo** (Swagger UI) from http://kazu.korea.ac.kr/](http://kazu.korea.ac.kr/)

# Quickstart

## Install

Python version 3.9 or higher is required (tested with Python 3.9).

Either:

`pip install kazu`

or download the wheel from the release page and install locally.

If you intend to use [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) on your own codebase, consider installing Kazu using:

`pip install kazu[typed]`

This will pull in typing stubs for kazu's dependencies (such as [types-requests](https://pypi.org/project/types-requests/) for [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
so that mypy has access to as much relevant typing information as possible when type checking your codebase. Otherwise (depending on mypy config), you may see errors when running mypy like:

```
.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/kazu/steps/linking/post_processing/xref_manager.py:10: error: Library stubs not installed for "requests" [import]
```

## Getting the model pack

For most functionality, you will also need the Kazu model pack. This is tied to each release, and can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/astrazeneca/kazu/releases). Once downloaded,
extract the archive and:

`export KAZU_MODEL_PACK=<path to the extracted archive>`

Kazu is highly configurable (using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/)), although it comes preconfigured with defaults appropriate for most literature processing use cases.
To make use of these, and process a simple document:

```python
import hydra
from hydra.utils import instantiate

from kazu.data.data import Document
from kazu.pipeline import Pipeline
from kazu.utils.constants import HYDRA_VERSION_BASE
from pathlib import Path
import os

# the hydra config is kept in the model pack
cdir = Path(os.environ["KAZU_MODEL_PACK"]).joinpath("conf")


@hydra.main(
    version_base=HYDRA_VERSION_BASE, config_path=str(cdir), config_name="config"
)
def kazu_test(cfg):
    pipeline: Pipeline = instantiate(cfg.Pipeline)
    text = "EGFR mutations are often implicated in lung cancer"
    doc = Document.create_simple_document(text)
    pipeline([doc])
    print(f"{doc.get_entities()}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    kazu_test()
```
