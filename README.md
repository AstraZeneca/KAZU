# Kazu - Biomedical NLP Framework

Welcome to Kazu (Korea AstraZeneca University), a python biomedical NLP framework built in collaboration with Korea University,
designed to handle production workloads.

This library aims to simplify the process of using state of the art NLP research in production systems. Some of the 
research contained within are our own, but most of it comes from the community, for which we are immensely grateful.

If you want to use Kazu, please cite our EMNLP 2022 publication!

# Quickstart

## Install

Either: 

`pip install kazu`

or download the wheel from the release page and install locally.

## Getting the model pack

For most functionality, you will also need the Kazu model pack. This is tied to each release, and can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/astrazeneca/kazu/releases). Once downloaded,
extract the archive and:

`export KAZU_MODEL_PACK=<path to the extracted archive>`

Kazu is highly configurable (using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/)), although it comes preconfigured with defaults appropriate for most literature processing use cases. 
To make use of these, and process a simple document:

```python

from hydra import initialize_config_dir, compose

from kazu.data.data import Document
from kazu.pipeline import Pipeline, load_steps
from pathlib import Path
import os

# the hydra config is kept in the model pack
cdir = Path(os.environ["KAZU_MODEL_PACK"]).joinpath('conf')  
with initialize_config_dir(config_dir=str(cdir)):
    cfg = compose(
        config_name="config",
        overrides=[],
    )
    pipeline = Pipeline(load_steps(cfg))
    text = "EGFR mutations are often implicated in lung cancer"
    doc = Document.create_simple_document(text)
    pipeline([doc])
    print(f"{doc.get_entities()}")

```
